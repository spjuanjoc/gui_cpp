# Hello ImGui

This is a "Hello World" for ImGUI. ImGUI requires a backend. This example uses
SFML as backend, with an already combined library ImGui-SFML from the
conan-bincrafters [recipe](https://bincrafters.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/Properties/conan%2Fbincrafters)

ImGui includes some features that go on top of SFML

[Example](https://eliasdaler.github.io/using-imgui-with-sfml-pt1/)

## Uses

- CMake
- std 17
- conan + bincrafters
- ImGUI + SFML
- fmt
