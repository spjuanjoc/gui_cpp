# Hello ImGui

This is a "Hello World" for ImGUI. ImGUI requires a backend. This example uses
a null backend to compile and link imgui, create a context, and run headless
with no inputs, no graphics output. This is useful to test building, but you
cannot interact with anything here.

The example can be found in the 
[ocornut imgui github](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/examples/example_null/main.cpp)
